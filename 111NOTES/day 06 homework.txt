DAY 06 HOMEWORK
===============

1. If you haven't finished reading tutorial parts assigned yesterday - finish them!

Pay special attention to ListView explanations.

2. Finish AllInputs project.

3. Do another Temperature Converter - "day 06 hw1 tempconv.png" from 111NOTES.

4. ADVANCED: Modify Notepad implementation from today
- change it to have File->Save and File->Save as... menu items.
- add two fields to MainWindow class:

string currOpenFile;

bool isModified;

Use the first field to implement File->Save behaviour.

Use the second field to make sure that user will never lose unsaved changes to a document. This is NOT easy.

You need to track changes to document, display yes/no/cancel message boxes when user is about to lose unsaved data.

Suggestion: use Window.Closing() event handler to prevent data lose on close.
