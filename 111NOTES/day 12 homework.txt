===============

1. If you haven't finished reading the tutorial - finish reading it.

In particular refresh sections about relations between entities.

2. Also read the following sections:
* http://www.entityframeworktutorial.net/querying-entity-graph-in-entity-framework.aspx
* http://www.entityframeworktutorial.net/eager-loading-in-entity-framework.aspx
* http://www.entityframeworktutorial.net/lazyloading-in-entity-framework.aspx

3. Create a new project Day12CarsEF which is based on Day10CarsCustDlg.

Your project will have the same UI, the same functionality (CRUD) but it will use Entity Framework to access database.

Make sure you can: Add, Modify (double click on the list), Delete (context menu on the list) cars using the program.
