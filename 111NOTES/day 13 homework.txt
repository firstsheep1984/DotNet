HOMEWORK

EF - Trains and Passengers
---------------------------------

Create WPF (GUI) project Day13TravelsEF.

Add Entity Framework via NuGet. 

Create DbContext class named TravelDbContext.

Create two entities and enumeration as follows:

class Passenger {
	int Id;
	string Name; // 1-50 characters
	Gender Gender;
	Train Train; // may be null
	
	[NotMapped] // you may not need this computed property
	TrainDesc {
		get { // handle when train is Null
			return $"{Train.Number} on {Train.Date}"
		}
	}
}

enum Gender { Male = 1, Female = 2, NA = 3 };

class Train {
	int Id;
	int Number; // train number e.g. 678 range 1-999
	DateTime Date; // date only, time is irrelevant
	ICollection<Passenger> PassengersCollection;
	
	[NotMapped] // you may not need this computed property
	PassengerNamesStr {
		get { // handle when train is Null
			return string.Join(", ", PassengersCollection);			
		}
	}
}

Enable database migrations.

Your main task is to DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT a GUI application that will allow for the following operations:
* View list of trains
* For a specific train view a list of all passengers that travel on it
* Add a train
* View list of passengers with trains they travel on
* Add a passenger
* Assign passenger to travel on a train (or remove passenger from that train)
* Delete train and all passengers that are traveling on that train.

NOTE: this is NOT a console application but a WPF/GUI application.

You will use Entity Framework to implement data storage for this application.

NOTE: If you can't figure out how to design and implement a WPF GUI for such an application then implement the project as a Console DotNet Framework application with a menu like we did in class previously.
